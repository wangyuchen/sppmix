\title{sppmix: Poisson point process modeling using mixture models for the intensity function}
\description{
Modeling spatial point patterns using Poisson point processes with mixture intensity function
}
\details{
This package implemented data structures and methods for modelling spatial
point process data using mixtures of normal component.

Based on \code{spatstat} package's \code{ppp} class for point pattern and
\code{owin} class for window, we implemented a \code{normmix} class for
dealing with 2D normal mixture.

Data augmentation MCMC (DAMCMC) and birth-death MCMC (BDMCMC) are the two
main methods we have for estimating normal mixture to point pattern data.

The MCMC algorithms are implemented in C++ using \code{Rcpp} and
\code{RcppArmadillo}, and it's significantly faster than some other R
implementations.

We used \code{rgl} to create a 3D normal mixture intensity plot for
\code{normmix}.
