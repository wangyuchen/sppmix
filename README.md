## sppmix: 2D normal mixture models for spatial point process

This package implemented classes and methods for modeling spatial point process data using mixtures of normal component. 

Based on spatstat package's `ppp` class for point patterns and `owin` class for window, we implemented the `normmix` class for operation with 2D normal mixture, and the `intensity_surface` class for an intensity surface with normal mixture density. Standard S3 methods like `plot` and `summary` are provided.
