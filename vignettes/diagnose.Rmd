In the document, we will demonstrate the effect of label switching on model 
fitting, different ways to mitigate or eliminate this effect, goodness of fit
test and model seletion methods.

## Label switching
### Effect of label switching
Label switching usually happens during the fitting of mixture models whose components 
are overlapping. We use the following example to show the effect of label switching.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sppmix)
int_surf <- normmix(ps = c(.3, .2, .5),
                    mus = list(c(0.2, 0.2), c(0.2, 0.5), c(.6, .6)),
                    sigmas = list(.01*diag(2), .01*diag(2), .01*diag(2)),
                    lambda = 100,
                    win = square(1))
```
The intensity surface of the truth model shows that among the three components, 
two of them are overlapping. 

```{r,webgl=TRUE}
plot(int_surf)
```

Generate a point pattern from this model and fit this pattern by using `est_mix_damcmc()`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pp <- rsppmix(int_surf)
plot(pp, int_surf$mus)
fit <- est_mix_damcmc(pp, m=3, truncate = TRUE)
```

Get the posterior mean after burnin and plot the estimated intensity surface.

```{r}
postmean <- get_post(fit)
plot(postmean)
plotmix_2d(postmean, fit$data)
```

The plots of intensity surface shows that all components are in the center of the
domain. The model doesn't fitted well.

### Diagnositc for label switching
We can detect label switching by using `plot_chains()`, i.e. trace plot for the MCMC chain of $\mu$ and p.

```{r}
plot_chains(fit)
```

The plots of chains show sudden changes of the parameter values, which indicate 
label switching. Also, we can use `test_labswitch()` to detect label switching.

```{r}
test_labswitch(fit$genmus)
```

### Remedial methods for label swithcing

After label swithcing is detected, we can use `FixLS_da()` function to mitigate 
the effect of label switching. 

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fit2 <- FixLS_da(fit)
postmean2 <- get_post(fit2)
plot(postmean2)
plotmix_2d(postmean2, pattern = fit$data)
```

Also, to get the intensity surface, we can use function `plot_avgsurf()` to plot 
the average of posterior surfaces, which will not be affected by label switching.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_avgsurf(fit)
```

### Goodness of fit test
Function `mc_gof()` can be used for goodness of fit test. `mc_gof()` uses Monte Carlo
realizations of pattern patterns to simulated the distribution of test statistic and 
conducts the T-test.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gofts <- mc_gof(pp, postmean2, alpha = 0.05)
gofts
```


### Model selection
We can use function `selectMix()` to select best number of components and also fit
the model by using the best number of component. Notice, all possibel numbers of components
need to be specified.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
best_fit <- selectMix(pp, 1:5)
best_fit
```

The function `selectMix()` returns AIC, BIC and ICLC values for each model. Minimum value 
indicates the best model.

Another approach for model selection is to use birth-death MCMC (Stephens M.(2000)).
To fit a Birth-Death MCMC, use function ```est_mix_bdmcmc```. In this case, the parameter ```m``` is not the component of the mixture, but the maximum component in a Birth-death MCMC algorithm.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fitbd <- est_mix_bdmcmc(pp, 5)
tb <- tabulate(fitbd$numcomp, fitbd$maxnumcomp)
mp <- barplot(tb,names.arg=1:fitbd$maxnumcomp,
                 xlab="Number of Components",ylab="Iterations",
                 main="Distribution of the number of components"
                 ,ylim=c(0,1.2*max(tb)))
```
The histogram of number of components suggests the model with 4 components is the best. Plot the posterior sufrace of model with 4 component.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
modelcomp4 <- get_post(fitbd, num_comp = 4)
plot(modelcomp4)
plotmix_2d(modelcomp4, fit$data)
```

Also, we can plot the average surfaces of birth-death MCMC.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(fitbd)
```
